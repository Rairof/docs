Inside the `settings.json` file, the loader may be configured by creating a `unbound` -> `loader` key and adding any of the properties below.

### Flags

<br />

<ResponseField name='enabled' type='boolean'>
  Decides wether the JavaScript bundle will be injected into the app or not. If you'd like to completely disable Unbound temporarily, this is the flag you're looking for.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name='devtools' type='boolean'>
 	As stated in the name, this provides tools for developers such as React DevTools, which is crucial for patching various sections of the app's UI.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name='update' type='object'>
 	As stated in the name, this provides tools for developers such as React DevTools, which is crucial for patching various sections of the app's UI.
	<Expandable title='object'>
		<ResponseField name='url' type='string'>
			The bundle resource will be fetched from the URL provided in this option. You may override this if you'd like to load a bundle from somewhere else. Most commonly, you will want to use this if you are testing local changes on Unbound's bundle if you are looking to contribute.
		</ResponseField>
		<ResponseField name='force' type='boolean'>
			This will force the loader to always fetch the latest bundle from the URL provided in `update.url`. If no URL is provided in `update.url`, the loader will fall back to Unbound's official bundle URL.
		</ResponseField>
	</Expandable>
</ResponseField>
