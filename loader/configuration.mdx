Inside the `settings.json` file, the loader may be configured by creating a `unbound` -> `loader` key and adding any of the properties below.

### Flags

`enabled`: Decides wether the JavaScript bundle will be injected into the app or not. If you'd like to completely disable Unbound temporarily, this is the flag you're looking for.

`devtools`: As stated in the name, this provides tools for developers such as React DevTools, which is crucial for patching various sections of the app's UI.

`update.url`: The bundle resource will be fetched from the URL provided in this option. You may override this if you'd like to load a bundle from somewhere else. Most commonly, you will want to use this if you are testing local changes on Unbound's bundle if you are looking to contribute.

`update.force`: This will force the loader to always fetch the latest bundle from the URL provided in `bundle`. If no URL is provided in `bundle`, the loader will fall back to Unbound's official bundle URL.


### Configuration Example
```json
{
	"unbound": {
		"loader": {
			"enabled": true,
			"devtools": true,
			"update": {
				"force": false,
				"url": "https://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
			}
		}
	}
}
```
