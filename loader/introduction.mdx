A loader is a native tweak/module that patches certain native functions in order to achieve JavaScript execution. This is used to later load Unbound's JavaScript bundle which provides in-app access and functionality.

As Discord is a React Native application, we have several attack vectors for code execution.

**Although loaders are platform specific, we aim to provide the same consistent experience across all platforms.**
