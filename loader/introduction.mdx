The quoted text is explaining the concept of a loader in the context of injecting Unbound into Discord. It describes how a loader is a native tweak or module that patches specific native functions to enable JavaScript execution. This allows for loading Unbound's JavaScript bundle, which grants access and functionality within the Discord application. Additionally, it mentions that Discord being a React Native application provides multiple avenues for code execution. The statement also emphasizes the goal of ensuring a consistent experience across different platforms despite loaders being platform-specific.

A loader is a native tweak/module that patches certain native functions in order to achieve JavaScript execution. This is used to later load Unbound's JavaScript bundle which provides in-app access and functionality.

As Discord is a React Native application, we have several attack vectors for code execution.

**Although loaders are platform specific, we aim to provide the same consistent experience on all platforms.**
